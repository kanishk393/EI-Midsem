- # Detailed Summary of Critical Questions for Big Data

This text critically examines the limitations and challenges inherent in Big Data, arguing against the presumption that numbers alone can provide objective or comprehensive understanding. It stresses the importance of traditional intellectual methods and the necessity of critical scrutiny towards Big Data's methods, outcomes, and its implications on knowledge and societal norms. The discussion is structured around three main critiques: the overshadowing of traditional methodologies, the misleading nature of objectivity claims, and the misconceptions regarding the superiority of larger data sets.

## 1. The Overshadowing of Traditional Methodologies

- **Arrogant Dismissal of Other Disciplines**: The text opens by highlighting the dismissive attitude prevalent in Big Data circles towards other forms of analysis and intellectual traditions. It suggests that the focus on voluminous data neglects and sidelines other valuable methodologies for understanding human behavior and creations.
  
- **Loss of Intellectual Craft**: The sheer volume of Big Data is critiqued for drowning out traditional intellectual crafts and methodologies, thereby creating an unwelcoming environment for established forms of analysis.
  
- **Big Data as an Ontotheology**: Drawing on Berry's perspective, the text argues that Big Data introduces a new epoch that destabilizes traditional knowledge frameworks without the philosophical grounding essential for regulating knowledge.

- **Inbuilt Flaws and Limitations**: The text likens Big Data's specialized tools to Ford's assembly line, suggesting they predetermine and limit researchers' actions, leading to a narrow focus on present or immediate past events due to technical limitations (e.g., poor archiving and search functions in social media).

## 2. Misleading Claims to Objectivity and Accuracy

- **Quantitative Obsession**: The critique extends to the sociology discipline's pursuit of becoming a quantitative science, as echoed by Latour, and how Big Data perpetuates this obsession by making more social phenomena quantifiable.

- **Subjectivity in Data Interpretation**: Despite aspirations towards objectivity, the text emphasizes that working with Big Data remains a subjective endeavor. The processes of data cleaning, selection, and interpretation are inherently influenced by researchers' biases and perspectives.

- **Data Errors and Biases**: It points out the challenges of dealing with large, often unreliable data sets from the internet, which are prone to errors and losses. The necessity of acknowledging and accounting for these biases in data collection and interpretation is underscored.

- **Apophenia and Methodological Shortcomings**: The text warns against apophenia—the tendency to perceive patterns where none exist—due to the vast quantities of data available, exemplifying the need for critical and methodological rigor in data analysis.

## 3. Bigger Data Are Not Always Better Data

- **Methodological Relevance**: Asserts that the presence of large data quantities does not negate the relevance of methodological considerations, such as understanding the sample and its representativeness.

- **Twitter as a Case Study**: Discusses the methodological challenges of using Twitter data, highlighting issues such as the non-representativeness of Twitter users to the global population, the variety of user engagement, and the limitations of Twitter's data access APIs.

- **Combining Large Data Sets**: Addresses the complications that arise when merging data from multiple sources, emphasizing that such practices can amplify existing errors and biases, hence complicating the analysis further.

- **Value of Small Data**: Advocates for the recognition of 'small data' studies, which can offer significant insights at modest scales, illustrating this through the study of a single individual's information practices as a valuable counterpoint to Big Data approaches.

The text concludes by advocating for a balanced appreciation of both Big Data and traditional methodologies, urging for a careful, critical examination of Big Data's practices, its interpretative models, and the societal and epistemological implications of relying on large-scale data analysis. This critical examination is essential to prevent Big Data's models of intelligibility from solidifying into unchallenged orthodoxies, thereby ensuring a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of human behavior and societal phenomena.

# Detailed Summary of Big Data Contexts and Ethical Considerations

## 1. Contextual Meaning of Big Data

- **Big Data and Mathematical Models**: Large datasets often require reduction to fit into mathematical models, leading to a potential loss of context and value. This reductionism challenges the meaningful analysis of data.
- **Social Networks and Big Data**: The advent of social media has driven an industry obsession with the "social graph", leading researchers to analyze connections on platforms like Twitter and Facebook. However, these online social networks may not accurately reflect the nuanced sociograms and kinship networks studied by sociologists and anthropologists since the 1930s.
- **Personal Networks vs. Big Data Networks**: Traditional sociological and anthropological methods (surveys, interviews, observations) have focused on understanding personal networks, which are complex and contextually rich. In contrast, Big Data introduces "articulated" and "behavioral" networks, which, while valuable, cannot fully capture the depth of personal relationships.

## 2. Ethical Implications of Accessible Data

- **Privacy and Ethical Concerns**: The accessibility of data does not equate to ethical use. A notable example involves a Harvard research group's collection of Facebook profiles, leading to privacy breaches through data de-anonymization. This incident highlights the complex ethical landscape surrounding public data on social media platforms.
- **Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)**: Established to oversee research ethics, IRBs aim to protect human subjects by enforcing practices like informed consent and privacy protection. However, the Big Data era presents new ethical challenges that IRBs and researchers must navigate, emphasizing the need for accountability and ethical reflection in research practices.

## 3. Digital Divides in Big Data Access

- **Unequal Access to Data**: Access to Big Data is not uniform, creating disparities between those with and without access. Companies controlling large datasets have the power to determine who can conduct research, leading to a divide between the "Big Data rich" and the "Big Data poor".
- **Impact on Research and Skills**: The divide is further exacerbated by the requirement of computational skills for data analysis, favoring those with technical backgrounds and potentially sidelining important social science perspectives. This situation introduces new hierarchies within academia and research, influenced by factors such as gender and institutional resources.
- **Consequences of Limited Data Access**: Restricted access to proprietary data sets not only limits the scope of research questions but also raises concerns about the influence of commercial interests on academic freedom and the integrity of research findings.

## Conclusion

The integration of Big Data into research practices brings forth significant contextual, ethical, and access-related challenges. While Big Data offers invaluable insights, it is crucial to maintain context, adhere to ethical standards, and address the digital divides in data access to ensure responsible and meaningful research. As we navigate this era, continuous reflection on the assumptions, values, and biases inherent in Big Data research is essential for advancing knowledge while protecting the rights and well-being of individuals and communities.
