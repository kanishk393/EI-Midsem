The search, limited to English language articles, incorporated a range of publication types, including peer-reviewed journal articles, commentaries, reports, white papers, and scientific books, without date restrictions.

### Search Strategy

Search terms were specifically designed to focus on articles mentioning 'Big Data' alongside ethics or morality. The review was divided into two categories for a focused analysis: 'Big Data' and 'biomedical Big Data'. This strategy aimed to capture the breadth of ethical discussions without being narrowed down by specific terms like 'biobanks' or 'informed consent'. The relevance of articles was determined by their discussion of ethical issues, disregarding the quality or length of the discussion.

## Data Analysis Process

The analysis highlighted key passages from each article, which were then interpreted and grouped into themes across multiple sources. This thematic grouping emerged organically without adhering to a pre-defined theoretical framework. The analysis aimed to address two critical questions:
1. The conceptualization of 'Big Data' within ethical discussions.
2. The types of ethical issues raised by Big Data.

Coding was used to categorize highlighted segments based on the authors' interpretation, later grouped into ethical themes. NVivo 10 software facilitated a systematic review, ensuring all sources were re-checked for the emerging themes. The analysis adopted terminologies for 'Big Data stakeholders': 'data subject' (individual described by the data), 'data custodian' (individual or organization hosting or archiving the data), and 'data analyst' (individual or organization analyzing the data).

## Results

From the initial 365 non-unique sources, 68 met the inclusion criteria after a detailed review process. The discussions were split between biomedical data (36 sources) and general data types (32 sources). The literature comprised 43 original research or in-depth analysis articles and 25 commentary sources, with only 7 including empirical research. A significant focus was on in-depth discussion of ethics, with 23 sources dedicated to ethical aspects of Big Data.

The meta-analysis presents a **narrative overview** highlighting key themes and topics from the literature, serving as a reference point for future discussions on the development, regulation, and ethical evaluation of Big Data practices. This overview answers the primary questions of how 'Big Data' is conceptualized within ethical discussions and the variety of ethical issues it raises.
